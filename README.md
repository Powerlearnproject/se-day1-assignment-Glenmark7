Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is a branch of computer science that uses principles to design, develop, test and maintain a software.
reliability- ensures that software is rigorously tested and built to high standards to minimize failures.
flexibility- easier to scale or update systems as technology or user demands evolve.
efficiency- focuses on optimizing resource use.
Security- Implements safeguards such as encryption, authentication, and authorization to protect sensitive data.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Structured programming introduced the practice of breaking programs into smaller, manageable units using control structures like loops and conditionals.
Object-Oriented Programming- brought concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Emergence of Open Source Software- Accelerated innovation through collaborative development and reduced costs for businesses.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning- outline project goals, scope, and feasibility.
Requirement Analysis- gather and document end-user needs.
Design- create architectural and technical blueprints.
Coding- translate designs into functional code.
Testing- identify and fix defects to ensure quality.
Deployment & Maintenance- release the product and provide updates and support.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall:
-Linear approach where phases completed sequentially.
-Low flexibility as it has late-stage feedback.
-Best for stable, well-defined projects e.g regulatory compliance systems.

Agile:
-Iterative cycles with continuous feedback.
-High adaptability to changing requirements.
-Ideal for dynamic projects e.g mobile apps.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- designs, codes and maintains software and collaborates with teams for best practices.
Quality Assurance Engineer- defines testing protocols, identifies bugs, and ensures compliance with requirements.
Project Manager- leads teams, coordinates timelines and communicates progress to stakeholders.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs- streamline coding with features like auto-completion, debugging, and syntax highlighting e.g Visual Studio Code and python
Version Control Systems- track code changes, enable collaboration, and facilitate error recovery e.g Git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapid Tech Changes- continuous learning and Agile adoption.
Time Constraints- break projects into sprints for manageable delivery.
Security Threats- implement proactive defense mechanisms and code reviews.
Changing Requirements- use modular design for flexibility.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing- validates individual components e.g functions.
Integration Testing- checks interactions between modules.
System Testing- assesses end-to-end functionality.
Acceptance Testing- confirms alignment with user requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It refers to the strategic design and refinement of input instructions to guide generative AI models in producing accurate, relevant and contextually appropriate outputs. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt- “Draw a picture of a person.”
Improved Prompt- “Create a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in the field with trees and grass in the background.”

Clarity- Specifies the output type (full-body portrait) instead of a generic “person.”
Specific- Details physical features (hair, clothing) and setting (field, weather) to narrow the AI’s focus.
Conciseness- Provides essential details without overwhelming complexity, ensuring the AI prioritizes key elements
